Using this figure shows us that the traders' average Sharpe of 0.70 was higher than the broad market, although on a first pass the difference was not significant (t-test, p = 0.13, two-tailed, n = 53. Figure 2). We thought it unlikely that the beginner traders among our cohort could either match or outperform the market so we divided the sample into beginner and experienced traders, beginners being defined as any trader who had traded for two years or less [7]. We found that beginner traders averaged a Sharpe Ratio of 0.39, not significantly different from that of the Dax (t-test, p = 0.41, two-tailed, n = 27. Figure 2), although first year traders had a negative Sharpe of -0.04. The experienced traders, however, achieved a Sharpe of 1.02, significantly higher than the Dax (t-test, p = 0.0001, two-tailed, n = 26. Figure 2).
